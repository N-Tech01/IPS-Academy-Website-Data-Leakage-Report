# IPS Academy Website Data Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
While browsing the website of IPS Academy (https://www.ipsacademy.org/), I came across a potential data leakage. Some sensitive data is accessible through the following link:  
`https://www.ipsacademy.org/assets/`

This could potentially expose private information and may be a security concern. Unauthorized users could access sensitive files, which might result in misuse of private data.

> **Note**: The data is accessible to unauthorized users.

## Steps
1. Visit the IPS Academy website: https://www.ipsacademy.org/
2. Navigate to the following URL: `https://www.ipsacademy.org/assets/`
3. Access to sensitive files such as images, documents, and other resources that should not be publicly available.

**Disclaimer: Use this for educational purposes only.**

## Recommendation
Please review this report and ensure the security of your website. It is highly recommended to restrict access to sensitive directories like `/assets/` using proper access control measures such as authentication or IP whitelisting. 

Additionally, implement security mechanisms like file permission settings to prevent unauthorized access to critical data.
