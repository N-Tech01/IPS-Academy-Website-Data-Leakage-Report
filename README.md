# IPS Academy Data Leakage Report

## Overview
Hello,  
My name is Navarath, and I would like to bring a potential security issue to your attention. I discovered this issue while exploring websites using Google Dorks as part of my learning in basic ethical hacking at CADD Centre. I am currently studying in 8th standard.

## Description of the Issue
